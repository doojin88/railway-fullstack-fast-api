## Why Deploy FastAPI Full-Stack on Railway?

Railway's zero-config deployments eliminate infrastructure complexity for full-stack applications. Automatic PostgreSQL provisioning, environment variable management, and seamless scaling handle the operational overhead. Deploy both frontend and backend services with integrated database connections, automatic HTTPS, and built-in monitoring—letting you focus on building features instead of managing infrastructure.
